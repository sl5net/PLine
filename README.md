# PLine (formerly autocivP)

This repository has been renamed from autocivP to PLine. The repository is focused on optimizing CommandLine features (the chosen symbol is â™‡ (PLine)) that enhance the configuration options and communication capabilities of the game without altering the gameplay itself. The changes mainly focus on making configuration easier, supporting multiple profiles, and improving communication functionalities like Jitsi integration. It also includes a powerful fuzzy search feature for all commands.

## Compatibility and Mod Integration

PLine is designed to be fully backward compatible with the autociv mod. It ensures smooth integration with the existing autociv mod, allowing you to seamlessly transition to PLine without any conflicts. PLine is also designed to be compatible with other mods, ensuring a hassle-free experience when using multiple mods together.

## Standalone Installation

PLine does not require other players to install it. It operates independently and provides additional features and enhancements to your own gameplay experience. Other players in the game do not need to have PLine installed for it to function correctly. However, it's important to note that other players can still benefit indirectly from the mod, for example, through improved communication in Jitsi audio team communication.
